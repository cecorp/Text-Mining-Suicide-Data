"Internet Forums for Suicide Bereavement: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Users.","Bailey, Eleanor; Krysinska, Karolina; O'Dea, Bridianne; Robinson, Jo","Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention",="02275910",,="20170810",,,,,"2017-34750-001","10.1027/0227-5910/a000471","Hogrefe Publishing",,"No terms assigned",,"Background: Bereavement by suicide is associated with a number of consequences including poor mental health outcomes and increased suicide risk. Despite this, the bereaved by suicide may be reluctant to seek help from friends, family, and professionals. Internet forums and social networking sites are a popular avenue of support for the bereaved, but to date there is a lack of research into their use and efficacy. Aims: To survey users of suicide bereavement Internet forums and Facebook groups regarding their help-seeking behaviors, use of forums, and perceived benefits and limitations of such use. Method: This study employed a cross-sectional design in which users of suicide bereavement Internet forums and Facebook groups completed an anonymous online survey. Results: Participants were 222 users of suicide bereavement Internet forums. Most participants (93.2%) had sought face-to-face help from sources other than Internet forums, but were more likely to seek help in the near future from informal rather than formal sources. Forums were perceived as highly beneficial and there were few limitations. Limitations: The generalizability of these results to other internet forums may be limited. Additionally, we were not able to examine differences between forums in terms of quality or user-reported efficacy. Finally, the data reflects the subjective views of forum users, which may differ from the views of moderators or experts. Conclusion: Internet forums, including Facebook groups, appear to be a useful adjunct to face-to-face help-seeking for supporting those who have been bereaved by suicide.

This study was designed to explore the types of online information and support available for people bereaved by suicide and the quality of such resources. Four popular Internet search engines were searched using terms related to suicide bereavement and support. Although a wide range of Internet resources exist for people bereaved by suicide, these resources may not meet basic quality standards. It is unknown who uses these sites, how such material is used, and whether it helps people to cope effectively with grief after suicide.

"What do the bereaved by suicide communicate in online support groups? A content analysis.","Schotanus-Dijkstra, Marijke; Havinga, Petra; van Ballegooijen, Wouter; Delfosse, Lynn; Mokkenstorm, Jan; Boon, Brigitte","Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention",="02275910",,="20140101","35","1","27","9","2013-34363-001","10.1027/0227-5910/a000225","Hogrefe Publishing","Journal Article","Bereavement; Grief; Suicide; Support Groups; Online Social Networks; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Male; Female",,"Background: Every year, more than six million people lose a loved one through suicide. These bereaved by suicide are at relatively high risk for mental illnesses including suicide. The social stigma attached to suicide often makes it difficult to talk about grief. Participating in online forums may be beneficial for the bereaved by suicide, but it is unknown what they communicate in these forums. Aims: What do the bereaved by suicide communicate in online forums? We examined which self-help mechanisms, grief reactions, and experiences with health-care services they shared online. Method: We conducted a content analysis of 1,250 messages from 165 members of two Dutch language forums for the bereaved by suicide. Results: We found that sharing personal experiences featured most prominently in the messages, often with emotional expressions of grief. Other frequently used self-help mechanisms were expressions of support or empathy, providing advice, and universality (recognition), while experiences with health-care services featured only occasionally. Compared with previous studies about online forums for somatic illnesses, the bereaved by suicide communicated more personal experiences and engaged much less in chitchat. Conclusion: Online forums appear to have relevant additional value as a platform for talking about grief and finding support.

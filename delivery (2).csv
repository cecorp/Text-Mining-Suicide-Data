"A Linguistic Analysis of Suicide-Related Twitter Posts.","O'Dea, Bridianne; Larsen, Mark E.; Batterham, Philip J.; Calear, Alison L.; Christensen, Helen","Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention",="02275910",,="20170223",,,,,"2017-08715-001","10.1027/0227-5910/a000443","Hogrefe Publishing",,"No terms assigned",,"Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Identifying those at risk and delivering timely interventions is challenging. Social media site Twitter is used to express suicidality. Automated linguistic analysis of suicide-related posts may help to differentiate those who require support or intervention from those who do not. Aims: This study aims to characterize the linguistic profiles of suicide-related Twitter posts. Method: Using a dataset of suicide-related Twitter posts previously coded for suicide risk by experts, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and regression analyses were conducted to determine differences in linguistic profiles. Results: When compared with matched non-suicide-related Twitter posts, strongly concerning suicide-related posts were characterized by a higher word count, increased use of first-person pronouns, and more references to death. When compared with safe-to-ignore suicide-related posts, strongly concerning suicide-related posts were characterized by increased use of first-person pronouns, greater anger, and increased focus on the present. Other differences were found. Limitations: The predictive validity of the identified features needs further testing before these results can be used for interventional purposes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that strongly concerning suicide-related Twitter posts have unique linguistic profiles. The examination of Twitter data for the presence of such features may help to validate online risk assessments and determine those in need of further support or intervention.

"Responses to suicidal messages in an online support group: Comparison between trained volunteers and lay individuals.","Gilat, Itzhak; Tobin, Yishai; Shahar, Golan","Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology",="09337954",,="20121201","47","12","1929","7","2012-30851-006","10.1007/s00127-012-0508-7","Springer","Journal Article","Internet; Suicide; Suicide Prevention; Support Groups; Training; Individual Differences; Volunteers; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Purpose: Although trained volunteers are considered to be a valuable source of emotional first aid for individuals in crisis, there is a paucity of empirical evidence comparing them to lay individuals. The current study exploits a methodological opportunity engendered by an online support group in which both trained volunteers and lay individuals responded to the same distressful messages within the same naturally occurring setting. Method: The two groups were compared on the basis of the types of strategies they employed in response to 111 suicidal messages retrieved from an online support group operated by the Israeli Association of Emotional First Aid (ERAN). Results: Trained volunteers used a wider variety of strategies. They also employed more emotion-focused strategies and more therapeutic-like cognitive-focused strategies than the lay individuals. Self-disclosure was more prevalent among the responses of the lay individuals. Conclusions: Trained volunteers constitute a valuable community source of suicide prevention. The implications of the findings regarding the provision of crisis intervention and suicide prevention via an online support groups are discussed.

"Temporal and computerized psycholinguistic analysis of the blog of a Chinese adolescent suicide.","Li, Tim M. H.; Chau, Michael; Yip, Paul S. F.; Wong, Paul W.

Many personal documents are digitalized and easily found on the Internet, which can be used to advance suicide research. Aims: (1) To examine the temporal relationships between posting intensity and language use to sketch the suicidal process of a young man on the basis of his blog entries. (2) To investigate whether digitalized personal documents and paper documents of suicide cases have similar or different language patterns. Method: Firstly, 193 blog entries of a 13-year-old boy posted during the year prior to his suicide were analyzed using the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (CLIWC) program. The temporal relationships between posting intensity and language use were illustrated by time series visualization. Secondly, the findings of this case study were compared with previous case studies from a systematic search of three Ovid databases. Results: Posting frequency and language use in the blog helped sketch the suicidal process of the young boy. In this case study, the ratio of positive to negative emotion words was associated with the posting trend. Progressive self-referencing appeared to be a primary predictive sign of suicide. However, the comparison did not show other clearly consistent patterns. Conclusion: Digitalized personal documents, when interpreted with other information of the individual, provide insight into the suicidal process of completed suicides. This study extends the findings of psycholinguistic analyses of suicides to the Chinese social context and online document form.

"Who goes online for suicide-related reasons? A comparison of suicidal people who use the Internet for suicide-related reasons and those who do not.","Mok, Katherine; Jorm, Anthony F.; Pirkis, Jane","Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention",="02275910",,="20160101","37","2","112","9","2016-03593-001","10.1027/0227-5910/a000366","Hogrefe Publishing","Journal Article","Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Internet Usage; Coping Behavior; Internet; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",,"Background: Although people who use the Internet for suicide-related reasons have been found to report significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation, little is known about the characteristics of these users. Aims: To examine the differences between suicidal people who use the Internet for suicide-related reasons and those who do not. Method: Participants were 205 Australian citizens and permanent residents aged 18−24 years who had felt suicidal within the past year. Participants were recruited online through non-mental health-related websites and asked to complete an anonymous online survey. Results: In univariate analyses, suicide-related users reported significantly higher levels of social anxiety and lifetime and past year suicidal ideation than non-suicide-related users, as well as a higher likelihood of future suicide and overall higher risk for suicide. There were no differences on depressive symptoms and perceived social support. Both groups were unlikely to anticipate seeking help from any source and generally perceived similar barriers to offline help-seeking. Multivariate analyses showed that past year suicidal ideation and likelihood of future suicide significantly predicted suicide-related Internet use. Conclusions: Individuals may choose to go online for alternative methods of coping when their suicidal feelings become more severe, demonstrating the need for more online suicide prevention efforts.

In Study 1, suicidal persons' (n = 34) attributions as the cause of their condition, as expressed in their free online writing, were compared to those of emotionally distressed, nonsuicidal (n = 16) and to nondistressed (n = 15) individuals. Results showed that suicidal persons have significantly more stable and global attributions than do the other groups. In Study 2, expressions of self-focus in online written messages were compared among suicidal, two levels of nonsuicidal but distressed, and nondistressed individuals (200 messages in each group). With the use of various expressions of self-focus, findings showed that suicidal people were distinctively self-focused in their writing, unlike their counterparts. In Study 3, psychologically relevant themes in the online writing of suicidal (n = 39) and highly distressed, nonsuicidal persons (n = 24) were compared. Results revealed that the former expressed significantly more unbearable psychological pain and cognitive constriction than did the latter. The findings of the three studies are consistent with those found in examinations of offline writing. The research has important implications for the use of online environments for psychological research and means for assessment, as well as for understanding suicidality.
